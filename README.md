# Password-Generator

I created this password generator to satisfy the requirements below. Every user decision is recorded by using prompts, and the password is displayed in the page.

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data  
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria  
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security  

#GIVEN I need a new, secure password  
WHEN I click the button to generate a password  
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria  
WHEN prompted for password criteria  
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password  
WHEN prompted for the length of the password  
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters  
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password  
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters  
WHEN I answer each prompt  
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected  
WHEN all prompts are answered  
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria  
WHEN the password is generated  
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
